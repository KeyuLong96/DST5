## This is the **assessment 5** of Data Science Toolbox.

The members of group are 
- Keyu Long 
- Yewei Yuan 
- Mateusz Janczak
- Kostas Anstasakis.


### The data is about the malicious URLs.

### We will build beta version in colab or BC4.

#### The methods we can try are:
1. Neural Network(this should be done with feature extraction)
2. Autoencoder(this also should be done with feature extraction)
3. Convolutional Neural Network
4. Recurrent Neural Network(LSTM)

#### Processing step:
1. (Feature Engineering)
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Classification
4. Prediction
