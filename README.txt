This is the assessment 5 of Data Science Toolbox.


The data is huge ~500GB what make a great project to build data science portfolio. 
However, we are not going to build model on the whole data set just its subset, say 1GB for training data and 1GB of testing data. 
We will build beta version in colab and once we build the model we’ll move to BC4. 
There is 512GB available storage space in BC4, exact amount of free space we need for our model :). We agreed to proceed as follows:

1) make a subset of data
2) build a network (or use transfer learning method/ build model from scratch)
a) converting hexadecimal sequence representing each malware into a grayscale image
b) designing our baseline by using Netural Network for image recognition
c) designing Convolutional neural network’s architecture in colab.
3) once I’ve built our model in colab on our smaller data we will move to BC4 and use whole data set.
There will probably be some issues along the way and any ideas that come to our minds are welcome.
